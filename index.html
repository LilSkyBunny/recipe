    <p>Connecticut claims to have invented the hamburger back in 1900 when a customer hurriedly asked for a quick meal he could take on the run. Charlie Nagreen sandwiched a meatball between two slices of bread in 1885, creating what was known as a “Hamburger Charlie.” Frank and Charles Menches supposedly invented the hamburger in 1885 in Hamburg, New York, when the brothers ran out of the sausages they were selling and were forced to use ground beef.</p>
    <p>In 1904, it was said that the hamburger gained popularity at the World’s Fair in St. Louis, where it was sold by Fletcher Davis, a fry cook. In 1916, Walter Anderson, another fry cook, invented the hamburger bun, creating what resembles the hamburger we know today. Anderson became the co-founder of White Castle.</p>
    <p>Today, hamburgers are practically works of art for chefs. Like art, there are no rules to how we create our hamburger concoctions, from the patty to the bun, and especially the toppings.</p>
